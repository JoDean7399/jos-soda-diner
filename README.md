# Welcome to JOs Sodas && Diners

    This is an app that gives the user options to create a soda and/or a diner. 
        The soda option allows you to name the soda, give it a taste and fizziness rating and an option to serve your soda.

        The diner option allows you to name the diner, give it a location and serve the available sodas from the soda list.

        You will be able to update any of the details of the sodas or the diners without updating all the details.
            You will be able to remove a soda from a diner without removing it from the soda list.

        You will be able to delete a soda or a diner.

You will be able to delete and update the item. You can change one or all of the details. After deleting or updating a modal will diplay letting you know this has taken place. This will make the changes in mongo.

## Struggles

    My main struggle with this project was following the rabbit hole. I continue to struggle but I am starting to get it. Also getting from the front the back and then to the front again was very difficult. Fixing one thing broke 5 more it seemed. My frustration level at times was a hinderance. 

## Things I have learned

    This project has made me slow down and think about each step one step at a time. I want to get from A-Z in an instant. I think I should just know things and this has helped to know that I will get it but it will just take time and patience with myself.
